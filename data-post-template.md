# How to change the metadata

I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

Edit the metadata above here. Be sure to change the title at tags at the very least. You can then delete this section.

Edit the post link by changing the name. Be sure to include the date at the front of the link in YYYY-MM-DD format. For example, `2021-02-07-data-post-template.md`

If you are adding any images you need to add them to the appropriate folder as indicated in the cover-img, thumbnail-img, and share-img directories above

Separate tags with a comma.

# Required text

Include a short description of the dataset here.

Include a link to the dataset like this [Link text](https://www.google.com)
